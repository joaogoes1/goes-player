Android Music Player

This is a Music Player that one day it will have some nice features.

This project I started to develop when I was starting to study programming, after my first Android course.
The object of this app is study more about Android Framework and and go beyond what I learned in the course.

### Refactor
This app is in refactor (rewrite) process bringing this to the modernity (MAD skills).
Considering this is my first app after a Android course, before even start to study Computer Science, like OOP, a lot of things needs to be fixed, improved or updated.

Roadmap:
1. Update SDK Version
2. Migrate to Kotlin
3. Fix Files Access permission
4. Fix Service Player
5. Move to MVVM architecture
6. Migrate layout to Jetpack Compose
7. Modularize
