Android Music Player


This is a Music Player that one day it will have some nice features.

This project I started to develop when I was starting to study programming, after my first Android course.
The object of this app is study more about Android Framework and and go beyond what I learned in the course.

Because of that, this code haven't any good pratices and has a lot of problems.
I stopped to develop it for some years but today I'm refactoring on `app-rewrite` branch.
